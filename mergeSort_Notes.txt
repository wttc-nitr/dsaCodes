** if a solution uses recursion, it can NEVER be Constant Space solution. Stack space is needed for recursion.
and, Stack space is determined by DEPTH of Tree. For (Recursive) merge sort , stack space in O(log N); 
Also, for merging O(N) space is required.

so, space complexity of merge sort is O(N + log N) => O(N);

merge sort is stable sort, means the order of two numbers (with equal values) remains same.
this is due to => in merge function ->  if (arr[itr1] <= arr[itr2]) -> changing "<=" to "<" makes it Unstable.

similarly, in insertion sort, its stability can be removed during insertion, by checking if the previous value is greater than or "equal" to the current value
