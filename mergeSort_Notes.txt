merge sort is stable sort, means the order of two numbers (with equal values) remains same.
this is due to => in merge function ->  if (arr[itr1] <= arr[itr2]) -> changing "<=" to "<" makes it Unstable.

similarly, in insertion sort, its stability can be removed during insertion, by checking if the previous value is greater than or "equal" to the current value
