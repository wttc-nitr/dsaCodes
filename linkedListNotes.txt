&head  ---- address of head pointer
head   ---- address of Node
*head  ---- we are at Node. Can use dot operator, like (*head).data or (*head).next


head_ref    =  &head
*head_ref   =  head
**head_ref  =  *head  =  at Node
-----------------------------------------

Logic of deleteFirst -> if you want to modify the local variable of one function inside another function, pass a pointer to that variable. So, we're changing the value of head.
