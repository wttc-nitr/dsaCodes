backtracking uses DFS, while Branch n Bound uses BFS

choices + decision

3 ways to solve recursion problem : 
(a) draw recursive tree , using Input-Output method -> when decision making is clear
(b) induction-base-hypothesis -> make the Input smaller,  when decision making is not clear 
(c) choice diagram

Problems which are really recursive can be solved using recursive-tree (Input-Output) method,
problems which are made to solve using recursion, can be solved using IBH method.

{ first hypothesis, then induction and at last base condition. }

designing hypothesis means what should your function do,
induction means thinking what/how should ur function do at one input and what it should do at (just) smaller input.
{ for hypothesis-induction u need only two steps , don't need to sketch more than 2 steps }
base is smallest valid input
	e.g print 1 to n 
						p(n)    => 1, 2, 3, ....n
					or, p(n-1)	=> 1, 2, 3, ....n-1   and n

					for base : p(3) => p(2) and 3
							   p(2) => p(1) and 2
							   p(1) => 1
